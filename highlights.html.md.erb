Ops Manager v2.1 includes the following major features:

### <a id="multiple-logins"></a> Multiple Read-Only Users Can Be Logged in Simultaneously

Ops Manager users with **Full View** and **Restricted View** permissions can be logged in simultaneously. Previous to this change, only one user at a time could view Ops Manager.

### <a id="gcs-blobstore"></a> GCS Blobstore Available for External File Storage

You now have the option to select a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) blobstore as your external file storage.

### <a id="custom-banner"></a> Custom Banner Available for Web Apps and Ops Manager

From the Ops Manager settings, you can now add a custom banner to communicate important messages to operators. You can create a banner that appears on each page of the Ops Manager UI or write text that appears to each operator who shells into Ops Manager. For more information about navigating Ops Manager settings, see [Settings Page](../customizing/pcf-interface.html#settings).

### <a id="custom-kms"></a> Add Custom Encryption Key to AWS Installation

For Ops Manager for AWS, operators can specify a custom Key Management Service (KMS) encryption key to encrypt all the Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes in AWS. For more information, see [Configuring Amazon EBS Encryption](../customizing/cloudform-om-ebs-config.html). 

### <a id="azure-application-gateway"></a> Integrate Azure Application Gateway Load Balancers

You can associate an Azure Application Gateway as your load balancer within an Azure configuration. The Azure Application Gateway offers layer 7 load balancing capabilities, which include a web application firewall and end-to-end SSL encryption.

To learn more about Azure Application Gateway, see [Overview of Application Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-introduction) in the Azure documentation.

To learn more about configuring your load balancer for Azure, see the [Resource Config Page](../customizing/azure-om-config.html#resource-config) section in the *Configuring Ops Manager on Azure* topic.
