<html class="list-style-none"></html>

This topic highlights important new features included in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.2.


## <a id='om'></a> Ops Manager Highlights

Ops Manager v2.2 includes the following major features:

### <a id='multi-dc'></a> Multiple Data Centers on vSphere

Ops Manager now allows you to configure multiple vSphere data centers to a single BOSH director.

### <a id="om-credhub"></a> Ops Manager Credentials Stored in CredHub

For even greater security, Ops Manager sends user-specified credentials to BOSH CredHub on each deployment. For more information about where Ops Manager-specific credentials are stored, see [BOSH CredHub](../credhub/index.html#bosh).

For information about how this feature affects tile authors, see [PCF v2.2 Partners Release Notice](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-2/release-notes-2-2.html#om-credhub) in the _PCF Tile Developer Guide_.

### <a id="custom-ssl"></a> Specify a Custom Trusted SSL Certificate

Operators can specify a custom trusted SSL certificate and key for the Ops Manager server so that traffic isn't exposed to man-in-the-middle attacks when using Ops Manager.

By default, Ops Manager uses an auto-generated self-signed certificate. To change this configuration to your own SSL certificate, go to **Settings** from the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and select the **SSL Certificate** pane. For more information about Ops Manager settings, see [Settings Page](../customizing/pcf-interface.html#settings) in the _Understanding the Ops Manager Interface_ topic.

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>Custom SSL certificate and key is persisted between upgrades. Custom SSL only needs a one-time configuration.</p>

### <a id="tls-blobstore"></a> TLS for Internal Blobstore Supported

Ops Manager now supports TLS communications for your internal blobstore. Ops Manager automatically generates and rotates TLS certifications for you.

To enable internal blobstore TLS communications, all of your tiles must have stemcells v3468 or later. You must also disable **Allow Legacy Agents** in the **Director Config** pane of the BOSH Director tile.

### <a id="excluded-recursors"></a> Specify Excluded Recursors

In the BOSH Director tile, you can now enter a comma-separated list of IPs and ports you want to exclude from the DNS server.

## <a id='ert'></a> Pivotal Application Service (PAS) Highlights

### <a id="timestamp"></a> New Format for Diego Timestamps

Diego timestamps in logs are now in both a human- and machine-readable format. The new format also prevents the need for metrics tools or other services to parse a complex timestamp.

PAS, Windows, and Isolation Segment tiles now default to a RFC3339-format timestamp. You have an option to opt out of this format in the tile configuration.

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> Services like metrics tools may not anticipate the timestamp format change and parse the Diego logs assuming the previous format. The new timestamp format can result in unexpected behavior. If you experience issues, disable the format change in your tile configuration.</p>
