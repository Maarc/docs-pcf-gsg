<html class="list-style-none"></html>

This topic highlights important new features included in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.2.


## <a id='om'></a> Ops Manager Highlights

Ops Manager v2.2 includes the following major features:

### <a id='multi-dc'></a> Multiple Data Centers on vSphere

Ops Manager now allows you to configure multiple vSphere data centers to a single BOSH director.

### <a id="om-credhub"></a> Ops Manager Credentials Stored in CredHub

For even greater security, Ops Manager sends user-specified credentials to BOSH CredHub on each deployment. For more information about where Ops Manager-specific credentials are stored, see [BOSH CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/credhub/#bosh).

For information about how this feature affects tile authors, see [PCF v2.2 Partners Release Notice](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-2/release-notes-2-2.html#om-credhub) in the _PCF Tile Developer Guide_.

### <a id="tls-blobstore"></a> TLS for Internal Blobstore Supported

For even greater security, Ops Manager now supports TLS communications for your internal blobstore. Ops Manager automatically generates and rotates TLS certifications for you.

To enable internal blobstore TLS communications, all of your tiles must have stemcells v3468 or later. You must also disable **Allow Legacy Agents** in the **Director Config** pane of the BOSH Director tile.

### <a id="excluded-recursors"></a> Specify Excluded Recursors

In the BOSH Director tile, you can now enter a comma-separated list of IPs and ports you want to exclude from the DNS server.
