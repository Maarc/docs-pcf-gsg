You can assign the following roles to determine which operators in your organization make deployment changes, view credentials, and manage user roles in Ops Manager:

* **Ops Manager Administrator**: Full control over all Ops Manager configuration and settings, including assigning user roles and managing authentication
* **Full Control**: Write access to Ops Manager, including credentials
* **Restricted Control**: Write access to Ops Manager with no access to credentials
* **Full View**: Read-only access to Ops Manager UI and API endpoints, including credentials
* **Restricted View**: Read-only access to Ops Manager UI and API endpoints with no access to credentials

See [Configuring Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Ops Manager](../opsguide/config-rbac.html) for more information.

### <a id='ssh-banner'></a> Custom Login Banner

In Ops Manager v2.0, operators can set a custom banner that every user sees when they log in to the Ops Manager BOSH Director.
To set the banner, edit the **Custom SSH Banner** field in the **Director Config** page of the Ops Manager tile.

See the Configuring Ops Manager topic for your IaaS for more information.
  * [Amazon Web Services](../customizing/pcf-aws-manual-om-config.html#pcfaws-om-dirconfig)
  * [Google Cloud Platform](../customizing/gcp-om-config.html#director-config)
  * [Microsoft Azure](../customizing/azure-om-config.html#director-config)
  * [OpenStack](../customizing/openstack-om-config.html#director-config)
  * [vSphere](../customizing/vsphere-config.html#dir-config)

### <a id='azure-stack'></a> Azure Stack Support (Beta)

Operators can deploy Ops Manager v2.0 to Microsoft Azure in their own local datacenter using Azure Stack.

See [Deploying BOSH and Ops Manager to Azure Manually](../customizing/azure-om-deploy.html) for more information.

### <a id='bosh-metrics'></a> BOSH System Metrics Available in Loggregator Firehose

PCF now forwards BOSH health metrics generated for all VMs in a deployment to the Loggregator Firehose by default. For more information about this feature and its implementation, see the *BOSH System Metrics Forwarder* section in the [Overview of the Loggregator System](../loggregator/architecture.html#other-components).

### <a id='bosh-cli'></a> BOSH CLI Renamed

Similar to previous Ops Manager versions, the Ops Manager VM includes both versions of the BOSH CLI.
In Ops Manager v2.0, both versions of the BOSH CLI have been renamed.

If you used BOSH CLI v2 in earlier versions of Ops Manager, you ran commands using `bosh2`.
In Ops Manager v2.0, run the same commands using `bosh`.
For example, see the following table to compare the changes to the `bosh vms` command:

| **BOSH CLI Version** | **PCF v1.12** | **PCF v2.0** |
|----------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **BOSH CLI v1** | `bosh vms` | `bosh-old vms` |
| **BOSH CLI v2** | `bosh2 -e MY-ENV vms` | `bosh -e MY-ENV vms`

Many BOSH CLI v1 commands are incompatible with the BOSH Director.
Pivotal recommends using BOSH CLI v2 commands for compatibility with future versions of PCF.

### <a id='nsx-om'></a> VMware NSX-T Networking Support

Ops Manager v2.0 adds support for VMware NSX-T networking.
NSX is a networking solution for VMware that provides a firewall, load balancing, and NAT/SNAT services for PCF. NSX-T is intended to work across multiple clouds and provide networking for container platforms.
Previous versions of Ops Manager supported NSX-V.

When you upgrade from a previous version of Ops Manager with NSX networking enabled, Ops Manager defaults to NSX-V. The NSX-T integration is only for fresh installs of PCF.
You can enable NSX-T networking by selecting **NSX-T** in the new **NSX Mode** dropdown menu of the **vCenter Config** pane.

See [Configuring Ops Manager on vSphere](../customizing/vsphere-config.html#vcenter-config) for more information.

Operators can additionally use the NSX Manager to configure policies for PCF applications. See the [NSX-T Container Plug-in for Kubernetes and Cloud
Foundry - Installation and Administration Guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod.tracker2/resource/85792716/nsxt_21_ncp_kubernetes-1127.pdf) for more information.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> You must have NSX-T v2.1 installed to use this integration.</p>

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The IPSec add-on is not supported with NSX-T.</p>

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change</strong>: If you opt out of the <a href="#bosh-dns">BOSH DNS feature</a>, your PCF deployment cannot support NSX-T networking.</p>

## <a id='ert'></a> Pivotal Application Service (PAS) Highlights

### <a id='nsx-pas'></a> VMware NSX-T Networking Support

PAS v2.0 adds support for VMware NSX-T networking.
NSX is a networking solution for VMware that provides a firewall, load balancing, and NAT/SNAT services for PCF. NSX-T is intended to work across multiple clouds and provide networking for container platforms.
Previous versions of PAS supported NSX-V networking.

To use NSX-T networking, you must install the NSX-T tile.

<p class='note warning'><strong>Warning:</strong> The NSX-T integration is only for fresh installs of PCF. You cannot upgrade an existing deployment to use NSX-T, and there is no upgrade path from NSX-V to NSX-T.</p>

To enable NSX-T networking for your PCF installation, you must perform the following steps:

1. In the Ops Manager Director tile > **vCenter Config** pane, select **NSX-T** from the **NSX Mode** drop-down menu. See [Step 2: vCenter Config Page](../customizing/vsphere-config.html#vcenter-config) in _Configuring Ops Manager on vSphere_ for more information.

1. Install the NSX-T tile. 
  - You must install the NSX-T tile after you install the Ops Manager Director tile.
  - You must install the NSX-T tile before you install the PAS tile.

1. In the PAS tile > **Networking** pane, under **Container Network Plugin Interface**, select **External**.

Operators can additionally use the NSX Manager to configure policies for PCF applications. See the [NSX-T Container Plug-in for Kubernetes and Cloud
Foundry - Installation and Administration Guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod.tracker2/resource/85792716/nsxt_21_ncp_kubernetes-1127.pdf) for more information.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> You must have NSX-T v2.1 installed to use this integration.</p>

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The IPSec add-on is not supported with NSX-T.</p>

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change</strong>: If you opt out of the <a href="#bosh-dns">BOSH DNS feature</a>, your PCF deployment cannot support NSX-T networking.</p>

###<a id='pas-credhub'></a> Secure Service Instance Credentials

The PAS tile now includes its own CredHub VM to support the secure storage of service instance credentials. Previously, PCF could only use the Cloud Controller database for storing these credentials.

### <a id='release-level-backup-restore'></a> Release-Level Backup and Restore

PAS v2.0 includes support for release-level backup and restore. [BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR)](../customizing/backup-restore/) now backs up each PAS component using scripts specific to the component. This new flow ensures services stop using the component database before it is backed up and improves the correctness of the backup. The steps to backup and restore with BBR are unchanged. For more information about component and service availability during backup, see [PAS Component Availability During Backup](../customizing/backup-restore/component-backups.html)

### <a id='colocated-errands'></a> Colocated Errands on Instance VMs

The PAS tile no longer includes individual errand VMs. Instead, the errand jobs are colocated on other VMs in the deployment. Colocated errands run faster than traditional errands and use fewer resources, including disk and IP space. These errands are now set to always run by default.
